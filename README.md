# Sorting_Visualizer
sorting visualizer project is a web-based application designed to showcase various sorting algorithms in action. Users can interact with the application to generate arrays of random numbers, visualize sorting algorithms step-by-step, and observe how each algorithm rearranges the elements into sorted order.
